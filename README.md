# Figments-of-Attention
In 2019, Amay Kataria was commissioned to create a new work for the show [Future is Here](http://futureishere.in/), curated by Dr. Arshiya Lokhandwala. It was an exhibition of 9 emerging Indian artists in the world. For this exhibition, he created [Figments of Attention](https://amaykataria.com/#/FigmentsOfAttention) - a metaphorical system of a swarm of synthetic agents called figments. Collectively, their flock resembles the state of human attention. The nature of the figments is to objectively flock together like a stream of human attention; however, by encountering apps along the way, they get distracted and break away from the swarm. Everytime the swarm starts disintegrating, a cacophony of the sound of addiction breaks out. Consequently, these figments nestle together but get distracted by the onslaught of more apps. With the constant rate of notifications we are fed by our technological devices, Figments of Attention reflects on our fragile ability to focus on everyday tasks.
